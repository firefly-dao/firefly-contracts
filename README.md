</p>

### Overview

The Firefly Bridge empowers users to batch transfer multiple types of tokens across heterogeneous blockchains. Users interact directly with the Firefly Router smart contract, providing transfer details via calldata to distribute various tokens to multiple destination chains and addresses in a single transaction. Firefly Bridge is designed for seamless cross-chain interoperability, supports a wide range of tokens and blockchains, and is fully open-source under the MIT license. All smart contracts are on-chain verified at the respective addresses.
